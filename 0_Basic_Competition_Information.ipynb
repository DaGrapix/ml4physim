    "\n",
    "This competition aims at promoting the use of ML based surrogate models to solve physical problems, through a task addressing a recently published dataset called AirfRANS related to airfoil design (CFD simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition will address the challenge of improving baseline solutions of the Airfoils design use case by building ML-based surrogate models. The overall aim is to improve the tradeoff between the precision of obtained solutions and the related computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](utils/img/criteria_airfoil.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the competition rely on our recently proposed benchmarking framework called LIPS (‚ÄúLearning Industrial Physical Systems‚Äù). This framework will be used to evaluate candidate solutions provided by the participants regarding significant criteria organized into 3 categories namely: ML related criteria, Physical Compliance criteria and OOD generalization criteria. For each submitted solution, a global score will be computed based on the aforementioned criteria to rank it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The help the development of new physics-informed ML models, the participants could use the [NVIDIA MODULUS Framework](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus/?ncid=ref-dev-171762-devce-lips), and benefit from NVIDIA support through a dedicated webinar at the beginning of the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The participants should train and fine-tune their models on their own computers based on the provided dataset. A cluster of 8 [NVIDIA RTX A6000](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/?ncid=ref-dev-171762-devce-lips) GPUs will be made available by [Exaion](https://exaion.edf.fr/en) for participants who may not have their own GPU resources. For the training phase, Baseline solutions will be made available to help participants.\n",
